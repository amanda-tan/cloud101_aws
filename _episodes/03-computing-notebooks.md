### How to do computations on your cloud machine

Now, we have data inside our cloud machine. Let's see how we can do some
computing with this data.

To install Python-related software, we'll make sure that our machine has the packages required for us to work with. 

Step 1. Install miniconda
We will install miniconda from this link: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
Let's choose 

Step 2. conda install 


- Install miniconda
- Install packages
- Get Jupyter Notebooks going
- Do some s3 bits from data/AWS Landsat - derive NDVI
