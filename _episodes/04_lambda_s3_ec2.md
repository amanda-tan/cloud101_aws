### EC2

- EC2 stands for AWS Virtual Machine that you pay for by the hour
- How do I interact with the Amazon cloud? Four answers: Console, command line, app, API
  - The console appears in your browser. You authenticate, navigate, wizardize, adjust, repeat
  - The command line you install on your local machine... and you will need to help it authenticate
  - The app is an app you install from the internet... and you will need to help it authenticate
  - The API is (in Python) something called boto. It permits you to do stuff on the cloud from within your Python code.
    - Substitute your favorite alternative language here if you are not a Pythonista
- Why do I have to interact with the Amazon cloud? 
  - Actually our goal is to *not* interact with the cloud; but rather to make the cloud vanish so you can get on with your work and life. 


### S3

- S3 stands for Something Simple Storage System and So-on
- S3 buckets live in AWS Regions and have infinite capacity per bucket
- They are not file systems
